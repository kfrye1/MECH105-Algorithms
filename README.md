# Simspon's 1/3 Rule
This is my Simpson's 1/3 algroithm.This algorithm approximates the value of an integral. The trapezoidal rule .
Call the function using Simpson(x,y) where the function numerically evaluates the integral of the vector of function values y with respect to x.
Function includes the following:Error check that the inputs are the same length.Error check that the x input is equally spaced.
Warn the user  if the trapezoidal rule has to be used on the last interval.Inputs
x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
y = the vector of function values with respect to xOutputs
I = the numerical integral calculated
This path includes code for the algorithm and code to test the algorithm
