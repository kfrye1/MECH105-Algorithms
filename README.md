LU Decomposition
This is the LU factorization algorithm that I created which implements Gaussian elimination
A - coefficient matrix (number of rows must equal number of columns
L (lower triangular matrix, with 1's along diagonals)
U (upper triangular matrix)
P (pivot matrix)
This path includes code for the algorithm and code to test the algorithm
