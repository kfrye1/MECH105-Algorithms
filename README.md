# Simspon's 1/3 Rule
This is my Simpson's 1/3 algroithm.This algorithm approximates the value of an integralusing the trapezoidal rule. IT calls the function using Simpson(x,y) where the function numerically evaluates the integral of the vector of function values y with respect to x.
x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
y = the vector of function values with respect to xOutputs
I = the numerical integral calculated
